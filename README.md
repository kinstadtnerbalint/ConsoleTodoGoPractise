# ConsoleTodoGoPractise
Console todo app, made with Go for practise purposes, used GORM lib for ORM

(the code is very basic, with the sole purpose of practising go syntax)

<p>
To run it, you need to set an Environmental variable in your IDE, named 'DB',
the value needs to be set with the following pattern (replace the tags wrapped in ''-s with your own DB info, without the ''-s)
'username':'password'@tcp('db_ip':'db_port')/'your_schema'?parseTime=true
</p>
